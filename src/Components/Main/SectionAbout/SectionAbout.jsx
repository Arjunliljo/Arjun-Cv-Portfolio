            Having transitioned from the world of graphic design, I'm now a
            full-stack developer fueled by a passion for building dynamic
            experiences. With a year of coding under my belt and a love for
            tackling LeetCode challenges, I'm eager to leverage my creativity
            and technical skills to bring innovative solutions to life.

            My journey in tech began with crafting visuals, but my passion
            evolved to building the interactive experiences behind them. Now, as
            a MERN Stack developer, I bridge design and development,
            transforming ideas into dynamic solutions.
